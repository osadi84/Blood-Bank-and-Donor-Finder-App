# Blood-Bank-and-Donor-Finder-App
A mobile app that helps users find nearby blood donors based on blood type.

Idea of the Application:
A mobile application that helps users find nearby blood donors based on blood type. Donors can register with their personal and contact details, while users can search and connect with suitable donors during emergencies. The app provides quick access to life-saving donor information.

Problem the App Aims to Solve:
During medical emergencies, finding a matching blood donor quickly is a major challenge. Traditional methods (phone calls, social media posts) are slow and unreliable.
This app solves the problem by creating a centralized, easy-to-use mobile platform that directly connects patients with compatible donors in their area, saving time and potentially saving lives.

Objectives:
- Register donors with their details and blood group.
- Search and filter donors by blood group and location.
- Allow users to contact donors easily.
- Maintain an organized donor database.

Main Features:
- Donor Registration (Name, Blood Type, Location, Contact Number)
- Search Donors by Blood Group & Location
- Donor List Display
- Contact Donor (Call / Message)
- Admin Panel (optional: verify donor details)
- Emergency Request Notification (future enhancement)

Tools & Technologies:
- Frontend: Jetpack Compose (Android Studio)
- Backend: ViewModel, LiveData, Kotlin Coroutines
- Database: Firebase Realtime Database or Room Database
- Version Control: GitHub
- IDE: Android Studio
- Language: Kotlin

Expected Outcome:
A fully functional mobile application that allows users to search and contact nearby blood donors based on blood type efficiently and quickly.
